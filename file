<span style="color: #000000;">Your privacy is extremely important to us. We are constantly putting a great deal of thought, effort, tools, resources and procedures in place in order to protect and safeguard your privacy. This document is our “Privacy Policy” and it contains details on issues related to your privacy when using our services. It is intended to inform you of our policies, procedures, and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of any information that you provide through the Platform.</span>

The terms in the Privacy Policy (such as, but not limited to, “we”, “our”, “us”, “Platform”, “Counselor”, “Counselor Services” etc) have the same meaning as in our Terms and Conditions document. When you use our Platform, you accept and agree to both the Terms and Conditions and to the Privacy Policy.

</ol>
<span style="color: #000000;">To let us operate the Platform effectively and to let you use the Platform, including the Counselor Services, we may have to collect your personally identifiable information (such as, but not limited to, your name, phone number and email address.), information related to the Counselor Services or your need for Counselor Services, and any information which is exchanged between you and your Counselor (collectively the “Information”). In some cases, some of the Information that you give to us is considered health-related data. You may decide which Information if any, you would like to share with us, but some functions of the Platform may not be available to you without providing us with the necessary information. By deciding to provide the Information you agree to our methods of collections and use, as well to other terms and provisions of this Privacy Policy.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Protecting this information is a top priority for us. We will never sell or rent any information you shared on the Platform. Other than in the limited ways detailed in this Privacy Policy, we will never use or disclose any Information unless you specifically and explicitly request or approve us to do so.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">The Information may be used for the following purposes:</span>

 	<li><span style="color: #000000;">To reach out to you, either ourselves or using the appropriate authorities, if either we or a Counselor have a good reason to believe that you or any other person may be in danger or may be either the cause or the victim of a criminal act.</span></li>
